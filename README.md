HackingChicago Project for Non profit Goodcity 

## Motivation

GoodCity invests in startups that are aimed to improve the life of minority groups. They need a way to keep track of donor information and manage their data to better facilitate 
donation information and give feedback back to the donors.

We developed a backend webapp that has a backend interface for GoodCity employee to interact with the data and a front end for the donors to browse their donation history.
With this dynamic platform, we hope donors can see their money making different impacts and willing to donate more.
